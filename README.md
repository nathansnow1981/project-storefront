## Syncing changes
-   Make and save your local changes
-   Open a terminal in `wherever_you_cloned_this_file\project-storefront`
-   Run `npm run deploy`
    


**Note:** 
-   If you want to run a local copy before syncing with the live copy, run `npm run start` to start your local node server, or `Ctrl + C` followed by `Y` then enter to stop the server.
-   Changes to the source files don't need to be manually pushed to the gh-pages branch to take effect, the `deploy` script does that for us.
-   We still want to push changes to whatever branch we are working on, then merge into the master branch as normal.
-   Changes will take a few minutes to take effect.
